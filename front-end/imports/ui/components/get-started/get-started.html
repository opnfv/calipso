      Administrators of Calipso can add new Environments, one or many, as pre-requisite for scanning, monitoring and visualizing. 
      “Environment” in Calipso means an OpenStack (or other cloud-based) infrastructure managed under a single administrative entity, controlling all endpoints and credentials on that infrastructure. For Calipso on OpenStack, multiple ‘regions’ means multiple environments, while regions are automatically discovered.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
      Calipso scans the environment through API adapter, Database adapter and Command-Line adapter, so credentials are needed for each of those methods. Click on "My Environments" to get started.

      Calipso environment setup is an automated extension to your hand accessing the endpoints like you would do manually through your administrative station, secure Calipso station like you would secure your administrative station, it makes sense to place it inside infrastructure management domain, treat it like any other OpenStack module.

      In this wizard Calipso captures the Environment Name and distribution variance.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso provides, in its core, the capability to support discovery of many variances of cloud virtual networking. Each release of Calipso will include a set of pre-defined lists that the back-end scanning engine uses for detailed discovery. Currently the environment variance has those main parameters:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Distribution: captures the specific vendor/distribution of the cloud infrastructure controllers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mechanism-Driver: captures the underlying vendor/plugin of the networking system in use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type-Driver: captures the underlying packet encapsulation used for layer-2 isolation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text">
      “Event based scan” allows updating the Calipso inventory in real time, it creates per-environment listener connected to the OpenStack message BUS and a smart update mechanism to keep the data synchronized. This is important for future discovery, while initial discovery is triggered by the administrator. You can uncheck this method to use other means of updating the inventory data like scheduled scans.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso needs credentials for accessing OpenStack API, underlying Database and host Command Line Interface, as it is currently agentless and underlying infrastructure lacks operations API to provide the necessary data.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      “OS API Endpoint” captures Keystone’s admin endpoint for accessing the entire OpenStack API:

      </div>

      <p class="text">
      Default settings gives you some examples of the formats, Calipso will validate your input and provide suggestions, TEST function will try to create a connection to that endpoint for validation. Calipso will first try to collect data through API, then any missing details through DB, then more missing details from CLI on the infrastructure hosts.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      DB credentials are needed to provide a much more granular insight into your OpenStack environment. Using the DB access Calipso collects more important data (read only) that is not available currently through API.
      </p>

      <div class="flex-box justify-content-between wrap">

      </div>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso is currently agentless, to minimize the impact of scanning. In order to access CLI on hosts, Calipso needs a “Master Host”, commonly referred to as a ‘jump-host’. This “jump-host” already have all the keys and routing access to all hosts running under the environment controllers. As administrator station, we recommend using PKI and password-less access to secure communications from the ‘jump-host’ itself to all other infrastructure hosts.  
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso will first SSH to that “Mater Host” and using its knowledge of the infrastructure will then SSH to all other hosts, using the “Master Host” as the source/initiator of subsequent connections. If required, Calispo host itself can be used as a “Master Host”, keeping access credentials local.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      This method of data gathering is needed for details that are currently not exposed through API. When other methods will provide those details (like an “Operations API” in future releases of Calipso agent on the hosts), Calipso can revise its discovery logic accordingly.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      The “Master Host” credentials can be username/password or ssh keys (recommended).
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso assumes all other OpenStack hosts are further accessible through this single entry point.

      If “Event based scan” was chosen for future data synchronization, AMQP credentials needs to be provided, this is used by the per-environment listener in Calipso:

      <p class="text">
      NFV Credentials are optional. Calipso can include an adapter to NFV application using the cloud infrastructure as its “VIM”, it then gives Calipso details about the underlying instances functions and capabilities, and this will be possible on some releases of Calipso.

      <p class="text">
      The Monitoring module in Calipso uses “Sensu” as underlying agent and framework.
      </p>

      See: <a href="https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/overview/architecture.html">

      </p>
      
      <p class="text">
      Calipso requires a pre-installed Sensu server and a Sensu client installed on all monitored infrastructure hosts to allow Calipso to check the health of many inventory objects that are an essential infrastructure networking components.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso includes a special configuration helper to aid the deployment of the Sensu framework for virtual networking monitoring. It provides cloud administrators with the necessary configurations to install on the hosts and on the Sensu server.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      In the “Monitoring” tab you define your preferred monitoring setup to be used by Calipso:
      </p>
      
      <div class="flex-box justify-content-between wrap">
        <div class="flex-box-1">
          <img src="/get-started/step-env-editing-monitoring.png" alt="" class="img_responsive" width="800">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text">
      “Environment Type” adds tags to messages received from any specific Sensu check on the clients, you can use it to level and/or isolate messages and loggings.
      Calipso uses RabbitMQ over SSL as the default transport mechanism from Sensu clients to Sensu server, it requires the following details for that transport mechanism: Port, User, Password, Sensu Server IP and Name. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Calipso assumes the SSL keys used for client-server communications are part of the Sensu pre-installed infrastructure and are placed at the default location on the Sensu server.
      See: <a href="https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/reference/ssl.html">https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/reference/ssl.html</a>
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      The “Type” attribute provides future ability to use different monitoring frameworks, currently only “Sensu” is supported.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      “Provision” attribute allows you to control the way Calispo configuration helper is used, here are the current options:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          “None”: Calipso configuration helper will not be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Files”: Calipso configuration helper will create and place all configuration files and remote checks, for Sensu server and clients in the “Config folder” location on the Calipso host, to be used by the administrator for manual deployment onto the Sensu framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          “DB”: Calipso configuration helper will create and place all configuration files and remote checks, as JSON documents, in the Calipso Mongo DB “monitoring_config” collection, to be used by the administrator for manual deployment onto the Sensu framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Deploy”: Calipso configuration helper will create and automatically place all configuration files and remote checks onto the Sensu framework, in the Sensu server and all Sensu clients (hosts). Configurations will be placed on the hosts in the default location: /etc/sensu/conf.d 
        </li>
